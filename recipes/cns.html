    </p>
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>

      <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li> ½ cup seasoned rice vinegar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
      <li> 1 tablespoon fish sauce</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha chile sauce</li>
      
      <li>

          1 tablespoon hoisin sauce
      </li>
      
      <li>
          1 teaspoon sesame oil

      </li>
      
      <li>
          1 cooked chicken breast
          
        </li>
        
        <li>
          1 (8 ounce) package spaghetti

      </li>
      
      <li>
          1 cup grated carrots

      </li>
      
      
      <li> ⅓ cup chopped cilantro</li>
    

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Whisk garlic, rice vinegar, soy sauce, fish sauce, brown sugar, Sriracha, hoisin, and sesame oil together 
        in a mixing bowl for the dressing.</li>
      
       <li>
        Tear chicken apart into strands similar in width to the spaghetti. Refrigerate until ready to use.

       </li>
      
       <li>
        Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. <br>
        Cook spaghetti in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, 
        until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.
    </li>
      
      
      <li>Transfer spaghetti to a mixing bowl; add the chicken, carrots, bell pepper, and green onions. Pour in the dressing and 
        toss by hand until well combined. <br>
        Seal the surface of the salad with plastic wrap and refrigerate, tossing occasionally, for 2 to 12 hours, the longer the better.
    </li>
      
       <li>Add peanuts, basil, mint, and cilantro to the salad. Toss well; taste and adjust for seasoning.</li>
      
       
    
    </ol>
