    <p>
        I'm gonna show you my favorite technique for stuffing pork chops, as well as one of my favorite stuffings for pork. <br>
         Above and beyond producing something that's visually impressive, we are also flavoring our pork chops from the inside out with this method. <br>
         So, this is basically a technique video and will work no matter what stuffing you decide to use--although this peach stuffing was <br>
         absolutely delicious.


    </p>
   
    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the Stuffing</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>2 slices bacon, sliced into 1/4-inch pieces</li>
      <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons diced poblano pepper</li>
      <li>1 large yellow peach - peeled, pitted, and diced</li>
      <li> 2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon Sriracha chile sauce</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
      <li>8 saltine crackers, crushed</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chicken broth, or as needed</li>
     
    </ul>

    <h3>For the pork chops</h3>
    <ul>

      <li>2 double-cut boneless pork chops</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>  
      <li>¼ cup chicken broth (Optional)</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</li> 
      <li> 2 tablespoons cold salted butter</li>
        
        
       
        
      </ul>
      
    


    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      
       <li>
        Cook bacon in a nonstick pan over medium heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. <br>
        Add onion and poblano pepper and saute until onion turns translucent, 5 to 6 minutes more. <br>
        Add peach and cook until tender and starting to give off some juice. Remove from heat and transfer to a bowl.
       </li>
      
    <li>
       Stir thyme leaves, black pepper, salt, cayenne, and saltine crackers into the peach mixture. <br>
        Add 2 tablespoons chicken broth if needed for added moisture. Refrigerate until needed.
    </li>
      
      
     <li>Fill the pockets with the stuffing, packing and pressing in firmly. Season both sides of the chops with salt.</li>
      
       <li>Heat olive oil in an oven-safe pan over high heat. <br>
        Sear chops in the hot oil until browned on one side, about 3 minutes. <br>
         Carefully turn the chops over and transfer the pan to the center of the oven.</li>
      
       
    
    </ol>
